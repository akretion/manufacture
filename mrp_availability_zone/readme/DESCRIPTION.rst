You can configure a larger zone than the location where the raw material is consumed in order to know if you have a shortage or no.
The use case is if you manage a small raw material stock, where it is consumed, but you have a larger location where you keep most of the raw material
where the reordering is easy. You want to be able to know which manufacturing orders you may start and which really can't start because of a shortage.
